<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Motivation</h2>
<p>Release engineering is a software engineering discipline concerned with the development, implementation, and improvement of processes to deploy high-quality software reliably and predictably <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-dyck2015a">61</a>]</span>. The changes made by developers of a software system should eventually be integrated and deployed such that end users may benefit from them. In recent years, release engineers have developed and adopted techniques to build infrastructures and pipelines which automate the process of releasing software to an increasingly large degree. These modern approaches have resulted in various practices such as releasing new versions of a software system in significantly shorter cycles.</p>
<p>Due to these developments being industry-driven, release engineering forms a largely uncharted territory for software engineering research. Efforts to close this gap would be relevant both for practitioners as well as researchers <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-adams2016a">4</a>]</span>. On the one hand, claims and rationales are presented by the industry to justify practices in release engineering, but these are often not empirically validated. For this reason, research should aim to build an understanding of the actual effects of release engineering practices on the software development process. On the other hand, software engineering researchers need to be aware of modern release engineering practices in order to account for them in their analyses. Otherwise, their lack of familiarity with these practices will likely result in biases in their study results.</p>
<p>This systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of the software analytics research that has been conducted so far on modern release engineering. Its main purpose is to identify the apparent gap between research and practice, in order to guide further research efforts.</p>
<div id="research-questions-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.1</span> Research Questions</h3>
<p>Contrary to what is regularly the case, advances in release engineering practices are driven by industry, instead of scientific research. Building on this idea, our questions are constructed to identify in which ways existing modern release engineering practices should still be studied in software analytics research. Our review thus aims to answer the following questions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>RQ1:</strong> <em>How is modern release engineering done in practice?</em></p>
<p>This question aims to identify the so-called “state of the practice” in release engineering. We will summarize practices that have been adopted to drive release engineering forward. In addition, we will identify the tools utilized to bring this about.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RQ2:</strong> <em>What aspects of modern release engineering have been studied in software analytics research so far?</em></p>
<p>In order to answer this question, we investigate the practices that previous empirical case studies have focused on. In doing so, we identify the associated costs and benefits that have been found, and the analysis methods used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RQ3:</strong> <em>What aspects of modern release engineering make for relevant study objects in future software analytics research?</em></p>
<p>In answering this question, we aim to identify the gap between practice and research in release engineering. This way, our intent is not only to guide but also to motivate future research.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Research Protocol</h2>
<p>Our research has been performed following the procedures for performing systematic reviews by Kitchenham <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kitchenham2004procedures">102</a>]</span>. In this process, we have set up strategies for searching, selecting and quality-assessing studies. Subsequently, we have extracted data from the selected studies and synthesized the answers to our research questions.</p>
<p>All the papers that were found, were stored in a custom-built web-based tool for conducting literature reviews. The source code of this tool is published in a GitHub repository.<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The tool was hosted on a virtual private server, such that all retrieved publications were stored centrally, accessible to all reviewers.</p>
<p>In order to save space in this chapter of the book, we have omitted the full research protocol from this chapter. The interested can find our research protocol in detail in <a href="ecosystem-analytics.html#appendix">Section 7.5</a>.</p>

<div id="rq1-modern-release-engineering-practices" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.1</span> RQ1: Modern Release Engineering Practices</h3>
<p>This section aims to answer to the question: <em>How is modern release engineering done in practice?</em></p>
<p>Adams et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-adams2016a">4</a>]</span> and Karvonen et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-karvonen2017a">91</a>]</span> have described release engineering practices that are currently in use in the industry. Adams et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-adams2016a">4</a>]</span> focused on modern release engineering, while Karvonen et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-karvonen2017a">91</a>]</span> investigated agile release engineering, which is a subset of all modern release engineering. Both studies agreed that modern release engineering consists of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rapid Releases (RR).</strong></p>
<p>In contrast with traditional release cycles, RRs regularly push new releases to users in a regular schedule. As an example, FireFox releases a new version every six weeks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DevOps.</strong></p>
<p>According to Dyck et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-dyck2015a">61</a>]</span>: “DevOps is an organizational approach that stresses empathy and cross-functional collaboration within and between teams (especially development and IT operations) in software development organizations, in order to operate resilient systems and accelerate delivery of changes.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Integration (CI).</strong></p>
<p>To quote Adams et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-adams2016a">4</a>]</span>: “[CI] refers to the activity of continuously polling the [version control system] for new commits or merges, checking these revisions out on dedicated build machines, compiling them and running an initial set of tests to check for regressions.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuous Deployment or Continuous Delivery.</strong></p>
<p>When the CI tests pass, the code can be automatically deployed to the production environment. The difference between these terms is that continuous delivery does not require that changes are automatically deployed, but continuous deployment always automatically deploys changes. However, the change might not yet be released, because it can be hidden using feature toggles <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-laukkanen2018a">106</a>]</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these four components, Adams et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-adams2016a">4</a>]</span> also identified three other concepts that are used in modern release engineering, specifically to release software as often as possible and thus enable continuous deployment or delivery:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Branching and Merging.</strong></p>
<p>There are several possible strategies of branching and merging. Typically, merging must be done as often as possible in order to release as often as possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build System.</strong></p>
<p>Building the software must be done in a consistent way, such that each build produces the same result. With the build configuration stored inside the project, every developer (or automated tool) only needs to issue a single command in order to build the project, instead of manually having to configure the build process every time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infrastructure-as-Code.</strong></p>
<p>In the same alley of “storing configuration”, infrastructure-as-code means that the server (or virtual machine) on which the software product is running can also be automatically configured with code, instead of having to configure each server manually.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these seven components that are more technical, Poo-Caamaño <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-poo-caamano2016a">151</a>]</span> has identified that there are also social aspects to modern release engineering. Specifically, most large software projects have a dedicated Release Team that will decide on the release strategies and communicate them to others.</p>

<div id="rq2-studied-parts-of-release-engineering" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.2</span> RQ2: Studied Parts of Release Engineering</h3>
<p>This section aims to answer to the question: <em>What aspects of modern release engineering have been studied in software analytics research so far?</em></p>
<p>Over the years, the software industry has come up with inventive approaches to deliver new features and fixes in a more efficient and faster manner. This has resulted in case studies being done to assess the associated risk and cost factors, and what benefits certain strategies can give.</p>
<p>Khomh et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-khomh2015a">94</a>]</span> have looked into the effects of switching from traditional to rapid release cycles in the case of Mozilla Firefox. The paper has concluded that users do not experience significantly more post-release bugs, bugs are fixed faster, but that users experience bugs earlier in the software execution. Mantyla et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-mantyla2015a">123</a>]</span> have also considered data from Mozilla Firefox and has examined the impact of release engineering on testing efforts. Observations of the paper conclude that the rapid release cycle performs more test executions per day, but these tests focus on a smaller subset of the test case corpus and that testing happens closer to release and is more continuous. A limitation of this study is that it measures correlation, rather than causation. Da Costa et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-da2014a">46</a>]</span> has further zoomed into the integration of addressed issues and has considered data from Mozilla Firefox, as well as data from ArgoUML and Eclipse. The paper found that addressed issues are usually delayed in a rapid release cycle and are often excluded from releases. Similar conclusions based on Mozilla Firefox were made by Da Costa et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-da2016a">47</a>]</span>, who found that minor-traditional releases tend to have less integration delay than major/minor-rapid releases.</p>
<p>Castelluccio et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-castelluccio2017a">35</a>]</span> has examined the practice of <em>patch uplifting</em> in the release management at Mozilla Firefox where patches that fix critical issues, or implement high-value features are often promoted directly from the development channel to a stabilization channel. The paper evaluated the characteristics of patch uplift decisions and interviewed three Mozilla release managers. The paper concluded that the majority of patch uplift decisions are made due to a wrong functionality or crash. The specificity and code author of patches that are requested to be uplifted are also a major factor for release managers.</p>
<p>In response to case studies being done on many prominent open source software projects, Teixeira <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-teixeira2017a">174</a>]</span> has described OpenStack’s shift to a liberal six-month release cycle. As this is an ongoing study, the results given by the paper are preliminary and only observe the process. OpenStack’s release process can be considered as a hybrid of feature-based and time-based releases. OpenStack encourages regular releases but also attempts to include new features at each regular release.</p>
<p>Rather than focussing on topics such as issue and delays, Poo-Caamaño <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-poo-caamano2016a">151</a>]</span> focusses on the communication in release engineering in the cases of GNOME and OpenStack. Through analyzing over 2.5 years of communication, the paper has made a number of observations. The paper found that developers tend to communicate through blogs, bug trackers, conferences, and hackfests. Another finding is that a release team is set to define requirements, quality standards, and coordination through (direct) communication. Although only the mailing lists of the projects were studied, defined challenges include keeping everyone informed and engaged, monitoring changes and setting priorities in cross-project coordination.</p>
<p>Laukkanen et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-laukkanen2018a">106</a>]</span> have described what effects modern release engineering have on software with different organizational contexts. This study specifically focusses on continuous deployment practices. The paper has found that high internal quality standards combined with the large distributed organizational context of large corporations slowed the verification process down and therefore had a negative impact on release capability. However, in small corporations, the lack of internal verification measures due to a lack of resources was mitigated by code review, disciplined CI and external verification by customers in customer environments. More about the factors that can play a role is addressed by Rodríguez et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-rodriguez2017a">160</a>]</span>, where an overview of contributing factors in continuous deployment are defined and categorized based on literature between 2001 and 2014.</p>
<p>As rapid release cycles and continuous deployment are topics that are new and emerging, not enough research has been done to generalize any conclusions that are made in the case studies discussed in this section. This is why all the empirical studies in this survey have one major sidenote in common: more case studies are needed. Open challenges such as these will be discussed in the next section.</p>

<div id="rq3-future-research" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.3</span> RQ3: Future Research</h3>
<p>This section aims to answer the question: <em>What aspects of modern release engineering make for relevant study objects in future software analytics research?</em></p>
<div id="general-suggestions" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.3.3.1</span> General Suggestions</h4>
<p>The body of literature that we analyzed for this survey mostly comprised case studies that employed quantitative analysis methods. From these studies, interesting conclusions have been drawn about the effects of release engineering practices on software development processes in specific contexts. However, the generalizability of the findings in these case studies is very limited. Therefore, in general many studies suggest that future research efforts focus on performing additional case studies, both to verify existing findings and to study new relationships and new contexts <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-adams2016a">4</a>, <a href="#ref-castelluccio2017a">35</a>, <a href="#ref-claes2017a">42</a>, <a href="#ref-karvonen2017a">91</a>, <a href="#ref-khomh2015a">94</a>, <a href="#ref-laukkanen2018a">106</a>, <a href="#ref-teixeira2017a">174</a>]</span>. It also seems worthwhile to triangulate findings by complementing data analyses with other quantitative (e.g. a survey) or qualitative (e.g. an interview) methods <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-karvonen2017a">91</a>]</span>. Finally, additional literature reviews will allow researchers to keep an overview of the most recent developments and findings in the area of release engineering <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-laukkanen2018a">106</a>, <a href="#ref-rodriguez2017a">160</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Apart from verifying results, it might be worthwhile to leverage them by constructing analysis tools for practitioners. For example, Castelluccio et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-castelluccio2017a">35</a>]</span> suggest exploring possibilities to leverage their research by building classifiers capable of automatically assessing the risk associated with patch uplift candidates and recommend patches that can be uplifted safely. Also, companies seem to be struggling with the adoption of continuous delivery and deployment, so a checklist for analyzing readiness for these practices might be developed <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-karvonen2017a">91</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The review by Karvonen et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-karvonen2017a">91</a>]</span> makes a number of general suggestions for future research. In particular, there should be more attention to comprehensively reporting how practices are implemented and in which context they are embedded, instead of just stating that they are used. Also, the viewpoints of different stakeholders other than developers can be taken into account. For example, the customer perceptions regarding the adoption of a certain practice can be investigated.</p>
</div>
<div id="directions-for-specific-practices" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.3.3.2</span> Directions for Specific Practices</h4>
<p><strong>Rapid Releases</strong></p>
<p>As established, rapid releases are a prevalent topic in current research on modern release engineering. However, it will be useful to verify these results given the fact that this research mainly involves case studies (most of which are only concerned with Mozilla Firefox due to the availability of data). To this end, there are opportunities to further investigate the effects of switching to rapid releases on:</p>
<ul>
<li>code integration <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-castelluccio2017a">35</a>, <a href="#ref-da2014a">46</a>, <a href="#ref-da2016a">47</a>, <a href="#ref-souza2015a">169</a>]</span>,</li>
<li>testing efforts <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-mantyla2015a">123</a>]</span>,</li>
<li>software quality <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-khomh2015a">94</a>, <a href="#ref-khomh2012a">95</a>]</span>,</li>
<li>(library) adoption <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-fujibayashi2017a">67</a>]</span></li>
<li>time pressure and work patterns <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-claes2017a">42</a>]</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DevOps</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to DevOps, future research is needed to refine its definition such that it is uniform and valid for many situations <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-dyck2015a">61</a>]</span>. According to Karvonen et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-karvonen2017a">91</a>]</span>, it seems that the goals in DevOps are congruent with those in release engineering, and future research on this topic is therefore highly relevant in order to study modern release engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Delivery / Deployment</strong></p>
<p>Research on continuous deployment seems to be still in its infancy, therefore Rodríguez et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-rodriguez2017a">160</a>]</span> have suggested a significant number of different concrete opportunities for future research. In general, they conclude that the topic needs an increase in the number and rigor of empirical studies, and thus it presents opportunities for software analytics research. In a systematic literature review, Laukkanen et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-laukkanen2017a">105</a>]</span> identified 40 problems, 28 causal relationships and 29 solutions related to the adoption of continuous delivery. These problems and solutions can be studied further to deepen the understanding of the nature of these problems and how to apply their solutions. Some of the problems that are more of a human or organizational nature might be involved with a broader spectrum of changes, so it should also be investigated to what extent these problems are specific to continuous delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Integration / Build system</strong></p>
<p>One of the main issues that seems to be obstructing organizations in adopting modern release engineering practices is build design <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-laukkanen2017a">105</a>]</span>. In a case study by Laukkanen et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-laukkanen2018a">106</a>]</span>, it was found that a complex automated build and integration system led to a more undisciplined one, which in turn slowed down the verification and release processes. Therefore, future research might investigate how developers can make their builds more maintainable and of higher quality, how anti-patterns in the design of the build can be refactored, and how continuous integration can be made faster and more energy efficient <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-adams2016a">4</a>]</span>.</p>

<div id="conclusion-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this literature survey, we have provided an answer to the following three research questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>RQ1:</strong> <em>How is modern release engineering done in practice?</em></p>
<p>We found that there are six important technical aspects to modern release engineering: Rapid Releases, DevOps, Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, Branching and Merging, Build Configuration and Infrastructure-as-code. The most important social aspect of modern release engineering is communication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RQ2:</strong> <em>What aspects of modern release engineering have been studied in software analytics research so far?</em></p>
<p>At this point in time, case studies have mainly focussed on the resulting factors of switching from a traditional release cycle to a rapid release cycle, and what effects this has in various organizational contexts. As all included studies suggest, more empirical studies are needed to be able to make general conclusions in the novel field of release engineering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RQ3:</strong> <em>What aspects of modern release engineering make for relevant study objects in future software analytics research?</em></p>
<p>In general, more empirical research is required to validate and generalize the results of many previous case studies within the field of release engineering. In addition to performing case studies involving quantitative analyses, it may be beneficial to triangulate results using various research methods. Also, future research should more comprehensively describe how practices are implemented, and consider different stakeholders. For each practice, future research is suggested on the one hand to further investigate their effects on the development process, and on the other hand to investigate problems involved with their adoption.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.5.2</span> Research Protocol</h3>
<p>In this appendix, we will describe in detail how we applied the protocol for performing systematic literature reviews by Kitchenham <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kitchenham2004procedures">102</a>]</span>. In order, we will go over the search strategy, study selection, study quality assessment, and data extraction. The last subsection will list which studies we included in this review and which we have found, but excluded from the review for a specific reason.</p>
<div id="search-strategy-1" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.5.2.1</span> Search Strategy</h4>
<p>Since release engineering is a relatively new research topic, we took an exploratory approach in collecting any literature revolving around the topic of release engineering from the perspective of software analytics. This aided us to determine a more narrow scope for our survey, subsequently to allow us to find additional literature to fit this scope.</p>
<p>At the start of this project, we were provided with an initial seed of five papers as a starting point for our literature survey <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-adams2016a">4</a>, <a href="#ref-da2014a">46</a>, <a href="#ref-da2016a">47</a>, <a href="#ref-khomh2015a">94</a>, <a href="#ref-khomh2012a">95</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>We collected other publications using two search engines: Scopus and Google Scholar. Each of the two search engines comprises several databases such as ACM Digital Library, Springer, IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect. The main query that we constructed is displayed in Figure 1. The publications found using this query were:</p>

<p>In addition to querying search engines as described above, references related to retrieved papers were analyzed. These reference lists were obtained from Google Scholar and from the <em>References</em> section in the papers themselves. We selected all papers on release engineering that are citing or being cited by the initial set of papers. Using this approach, we have found six additional papers. The results of the reference analysis are listed in Table 1.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.5.2.2</span> Study Selection</h4>
<p>We selected the studies that we wanted to include in the survey with aid of the aforementioned tool for storing the papers. In this tool, it is possible to label papers with tags and leave comments and ratings. Every paper is reviewed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on this, the tool allowed to filter out all papers that appeared not to be relevant for this literature survey.</p>
<p>We only used one exclusion criteria: studies that are published before 2014, will not be included in our survey (this is enforced by our search query). The inclusion criteria are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The study must show (at least) one release engineering technique.</li>
<li>The study must not just show a release engineering technique, but analyze its performance compared to other techniques.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.5.2.3</span> Study Quality Assessment</h4>
<p>Based on Kitchenham <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kitchenham2004procedures">102</a>]</span>, the quality of a paper will be assessed by the evidence it provides, based on the following scale. All levels of quality in this scale will be accepted, except for level 5 (evidence obtained from expert opinion).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evidence obtained from at least one properly-designed randomised controlled trial.</li>
<li>Evidence obtained from well-designed pseudo-randomised controlled trials (i.e. non-random allocation to treatment).</li>
<li>Comparative studies in a real-world setting:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evidence obtained from comparative studies with concurrent controls and allocation not randomised, cohort studies, case-control studies or interrupted time series with a control group.</li>
<li>Evidence obtained from comparative studies with historical control, two or more single arm studies, or interrupted time series without a parallel control group.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Experiments in artificial settings:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evidence obtained from a randomised experiment performed in an artificial setting.</li>
<li>Evidence obtained from case series, either post-test or pre-test/post-test.</li>
<li>Evidence obtained from a quasi-random experiment performed in an artificial setting.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Evidence obtained from expert opinion based on theory or consensus.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, the studies will be examined to see if they contain any type of bias. For this, the same types of biases will be used as described by <a href="mailto:Kitchenham@kitchenham2004procedures">Kitchenham@kitchenham2004procedures</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selection/Allocation bias: Systematic difference between comparison groups with respect to treatment.</li>
<li>Performance bias: Systematic difference is the conduct of comparison groups apart from the treatment being evaluated.</li>
<li>Measurement/Detection bias: Systematic difference between the groups in how outcomes are ascertained.</li>
<li>Attrition/Exclusion bias: Systematic differences between comparison groups in terms of withdrawals or exclusions of participants from the study sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>The studies will be labeled by their quality level and possible biases. This information can be used during the Data Synthesis phase to weigh the importance of individual studies <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kitchenham2004procedures">102</a>]</span>.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.5.2.4</span> Data Extraction</h4>
<p>To accurately capture the information contributed by each publication in our survey, we will use a systematic approach to extracting data. To guide this process, we will be using a data extraction form which describes what aspects of a publication are crucial to record. Besides general publication information (title, author etc.), the form contains questions that are based on our defined research questions. Furthermore, the form contains a section for quantitative research, where aspects such as population and evaluation will be documented. The form that is used for this is shown below:</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.5.2.5</span> Data Synthesis</h4>
<p>To summarize the contributions and limitations of each of the included publications, we will apply a descriptive synthesis approach. In this part of our survey, we will compare the data that was extracted of the included publications. Publications with similar findings will be grouped and evaluated, and differences between groups of publications will be structured and elaborated on. In this we will compare them using specifics such as their study types, time of publication and study quality.</p>
<p>If the extracted data allows for a structured tabular visualization of similarities and differences between publications this we serve as an additional form of synthesis. However, this depends on the final included publications of this survey.</p>

<li>Method(s) of recruitment of participants: Found on OpenStack’s website</li>
<li>Sample size: 47 mailing lists, 24,643 messages, grouped into 7,650 discussions. Filtered data: 14,486 messages grouped into 2,682 discussions.</li>
<li>Evaluation/measurement description: Counting</li>
<li>Outcomes:
<ul>
<li>Developers communicate via email, blogs, launchpad, wiki, gerrit, face-to-face, IRC, video-conferences, and etherpad.</li>
<li>Project Team Leaders and the Release Team members are the key players in the communication and coordination across projects in the context of release management</li>
<li>The tasks for the Release Team and Project Team Leaders:
<ul>
<li>defining the requirements of an OpenStack release</li>
<li>coordinating and communicating with projects and teams to reach the objectives of each milestone</li>
<li>coordinating feature freeze exceptions at the end of a release</li>
<li>shipping a release within defined quality and time specifications</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Major challenges of these teams:
<ul>
<li>coordinate projects and teams without direct power over them</li>
<li>keep everyone informed and engaged</li>
<li>decide what becomes part of of the integrated release</li>
<li>monitor changes</li>
<li>set priorities in cross-project coordination</li>
<li>overcome limitations of the communication infrastructure</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Limitations:
<ul>
<li>Only studies mailing list, to compare with GNOME case study</li>
<li>Possible subjective bias in manually categorizing email subjects</li>
<li>Not very generalizable, as it’s just one case study</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Future research:
<ul>
<li>Fix the limitations</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since there are two case studies, the results become a bit more generalizable</li>
<li>The author set up a theory that encapsulates the communication and coordination regarding release management in FOSS ecosystems, and can be summarized as:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The size and complexity of the integrated product is constrained by the release managers capacity</li>
<li>The release management should reach the whole ecosystem to increase awareness and participation</li>
<li>The release managers need social and technical skills</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Evaluation/measurement description: Associate commit log, bug reports and releases. Classify backouts. Measure rate of backouts against all fixed bugs, per month and per release strategy period. Test for statistical significance using Fisher’s exact test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</li>
<li>Outcomes:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Absolute numbers of bug fixes and backouts increased under rapid releases (probably the increase in regular contributors played a role, cannot conclude anything about workload.)</li>
<li>Backout rate increased under rapid releases (sheriff managed integration repositories may have increased the prevalence of backout culture)</li>

<li>cultural shift reduced testing efforts beforehand, and higher early backout rate eventually reduced the effort to integrate bug fixes for developers</li>

</ul>
<p>What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>Branching and merging
<ul>
<li>Software teams rely on Version Control Systems</li>
<li>Quality assurance activities like code reviews are used before doing a merge or even allowing a code change to be committed into a branch</li>
<li>Keep branches short-lived and merge often. If this is impossible, a rebase can be done.</li>
<li>“trunk-based development” can be applied to eliminate most branches below the master branch.</li>
<li>Feature toggles are used to provide isolation for new features in case of the absence of branches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Building and testing
<ul>
<li>To help assess build and test conflicts, many projects also provide “try” servers to development teams, which automatically runs a build and test process referred to as CI.</li>
<li>The CI process often does not run full test, but a representative subset.</li>
<li>The more intensive tests, such as integration, system or performance typically get run nightly or in weekends.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Build system:
<ul>
<li>GNU Make is the most popular file-based build system technology. Ant is the prototypical task-based build system technology. Lifecycle-based build technologies like Maven consider the build system of a project to have a sequence of standard build activities that together form a “build lifecycle.”</li>
<li>“Reproducible builds” involve for a given feature and hardware configuration of the code base, every build invoca- tion should yield bit-to-bit identical build results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Infrastructure-as-code
<ul>
<li>Containers or virtual machines are used to deploy new versions of the system for testing or even production.</li>
<li>It has been recommended that infrastructure code is to be stored in a separate VCS repository than source code, in order to restrict access to infrastructure code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deployment
<ul>
<li>The term “dark launching” corresponds to deploying new features without releasing them to the public, in which parts of the system automatically make calls to the hidden features in a way invisible to end users.</li>
<li>“Blue green deployment” deploys the next software version on a copy of the production environment, and changes this to be the main enviroment on release.</li>
<li>In “canary deployment” a prospective release of the software system is loaded onto a subset of the production environments for only a subset of users.</li>
<li>“A/B testing” deploys alternative A of a feature to the environment of a subset of the user base, while alternative B is deployed to the environment of another subset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Release
<ul>
<li>Once a deployed version of a system is released, the release engineers monitor telemetry data and crash logs to track the performance and quality of releases. Several frameworks and applications have been introduced for this.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Are these practices to be classified under dated, state of the art or state of the practice? Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of these practices are classified by the paper as state of the practice, but state of the art practices are also mentioned.</li>
</ul>
<p>What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>Branching and merging
<ul>
<li>No methodology or insight exists on how to empirically validate the best branching structure for a given organization or project, and what results in the smallest amount of merge conflicts.</li>
<li>Release engineers need to pay particular attention to conflicts and incompatibilities caused by evolving library and API dependencies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Building and testing
<ul>
<li>Speeding up CI might be the major concern of practitioners. This speed up can be achieved through predicting whether a code change will break the build, or by “chunking” code changes into a group and only compile and test each group once.</li>
<li>The concept of “green builds” slowly is becoming an issue, in the sense that frequent triggering of the CI server consumes energy.</li>
<li>Security of the release engineering pipeline in general, and the CI server in particular, also has become a major concern.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Release
<ul>
<li>Qualitative studies are not only essential to understand the rationale behind quantitative findings, but also to identify design patterns and best practices for build systems.
<ul>
<li>How can developers make their builds more maintainable and of higher quality?</li>
<li>What refactorings should be performed for which build system anti-patterns?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Identification and resolution of build bugs, i.e., source code or build specification changes that cause build breakage, possibly on a subset of the supported platforms.</li>
<li>Basic tools have a hard time determining what part of the system is necessary to build.</li>
<li>Studies on non-GNU Make build systems are missing.</li>
<li>Apart from identifying bottlenecks, such approaches should also suggest concrete refactorings of the build system specifications or source code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Infrastructure-as-code
<ul>
<li>Research on differences between infrastructure languages is lacking.</li>
<li>Best practices and design patterns for infrastructure-as-code need to be documented.</li>
<li>Qualitative analysis of infrastructure code will be necessary to understand how developers address different infrastructure needs.</li>
<li>Quantitative analysis of the version control and bug report systems can then help to determine which patterns were beneficial in terms of maintenance effort and/or quality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deployment
<ul>
<li>More emperical studies can be done to answer question like this:
<ul>
<li>Is blue-green deployment the fastest means to deploy a new version of a web app?</li>
<li>Are A/B testing and dark launching worth the investment and risk?</li>
<li>Should one use containers or virtual machines for a medium-sized web app in order to meet application performance and robustness criteria?</li>
<li>If an app is part of a suite of apps built around a common database, should each app be deployed in a different container?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Better tools for quality assurance are required, to prevent showstopper bugs from slipping through and requiring re-deployment of a mobile app version (with corresponding vetting), these include:
<ul>
<li>Defect prediction (either file- or commit-based)</li>
<li>Smarter/safer update mechanisms</li>
<li>Tools for improving code review</li>
<li>Generating tests</li>
<li>Filtering and interpreting crash reports</li>
<li>Prioritization and triaging of defect reports</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Release
<ul>
<li>More research is needed on determining which code change is the perfect one for triggering the release of one of these releases, or whether a canary is good enough to be released to another data centre.</li>
<li>Question such as the following should be investigated:
<ul>
<li>Should one release on all platforms at the same time?</li>
<li>In the case of defects, which platform should receive priority?</li>
<li>Should all platforms use the same version numbering, or should that be feature-dependent?</li>
<li>Research on the continuous delivery and rapid releases from other systems should be explored.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>What research gaps does this publication contain?</p>
<ul>
<li>As is common with surveys, it does not contain the state of the field today. More quantitive and qualitive research has been done, which can not possibly be included.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are these research gaps filled by any other publications in this survey?</p>

<li>Publication type: Conference paper</li>
<li>Type of study: Emperical study</li>
</ul>
<p>What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>To give a context to the study, the paper describes the concept of traditional releases, rapid releases, their differences, and how issue reports are structured.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are these practices to be classified under dated, state of the art or state of the practice? Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>State of the practice. The paper describes common practices that were in use at the time of the publication.</li>
</ul>
<p>What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>The study mentions that comparing systems with different release structures is difficult since one has to distinguish to what extent the results are due to the release strategy and which are due to intricacies of the systems or organization itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>What research gaps does this publication contain?</p>
<ul>
<li>The main gap in this study is the specificity of the data. Only Mozilla has been considered, and external factors such as other organizational challenges which could have an effect on release time could not be included. More research that looks further into comparing this case to that of other organizations is needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are these research gaps filled by any other publications in this survey?</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Quantitative research publications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study start date: Used data starts from 1999</li>
<li>Study end date or duration: Used data ends in 2010</li>
<li>Population description: The paper describes multiple steps to describe their data collection approach. The paper collected the date and version number of each Firefox release. Tags within the VCS were used to link issue IDs to releases. The paper discards issues that are potential false positives: IDs that have less five digits, issues that refer to tests instead of bugfixes, any potential ID that is the name of a file. Since the commit logs are linked to the VCS tags, the paper is able to link the issue IDs found within these commit logs to the releases that correspond to those tags.</li>
<li>Method(s) of recruitment of participants: Firefox release history wiki and VCS logs</li>
<li>Sample size: 72114 issue reports from the Firefox system (34673 for traditional releases and 37441 for rapid releases)</li>
<li>Evaluation/measurement description: The paper aims to answer three research questions:
<ul>
<li>Are addressed issues integrated more quickly in rapid releases?
<ul>
<li>Approach: Through beanplots to compare the distributions, the paper first observes the lifetime of the issues of traditional and rapid releases. Next, it looks at the time span of the triaging, fixing, and integration phases within the lifetime of an issue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why can traditional releases integrate addressed issues more quickly?
<ul>
<li>Approach: the paper groups traditional and rapid releases into major and minor releases and study their integration delay through beanplots, Mann-Whiteney-Wilcoxon tests, Cliff’s delta, and MAD.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Did the change in the release strategy have an impact on the characteristics of delayed issues?
<ul>
<li>Approach: the paper builds linear regression models for both release approaches. The paper firstly estimates the degrees of freedom that can be spent on the models. Secondly, they check for metrics that are highly correlated using Spearman rank correlation tests and perform a redundancy check to remove redundant metrics. The paper then assesses the fit of our models using the ROC area and the Brier score. The ROC area is used to evaluate the degree of discrimination achieved by the model. The Brier score is used to evaluate the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. The used metrics include reporter experience, resolver experience, issue severity, issue priority, project queue rank, number of impacted files and fix time. A full list of metrics can be found in Table 2 of the paper.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Outcomes:
<ul>
<li>Are addressed issues integrated more quickly in rapid releases?
<ul>
<li>Results: There is no significant difference between traditional and rapid releases regarding issue lifetime. Results:</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why can traditional releases integrate addressed issues more quickly?
<ul>
<li>Results: Minor-traditional releases tend to have less integration delay than major/minor-rapid releases.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Did the change in the release strategy have an impact on the characteristics of delayed issues?
<ul>
<li>Results: The models achieve a Brier score of 0.05- 0.16 and ROC areas of 0.81-0.83. Traditional releases prioritize the integration of backlog issues, while rapid releases prioritize the inte- gration of issues of the current release cycle.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Limitations: Defects in the tools that were developed to perform the data collection and evaluation could have an effect on the outcomes. Furthermore, the way that issue IDs are linked to releases may not represent the total addressed issues per release. The results cannot be generalized as the evaluation was solely done on the Firefox system.</li>
<li>Future research: Further research can look into applying the same evaluation strategy to other organizations that switched from traditional to rapid release.</li>

<p>What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>This paper discussed the developments of continuous development over the years until June 2014. This paper has performed a semantic study to identify, classify and analyze primary studies related to continuous development. The paper has found the following major points:
<ul>
<li>Almost all primary studies make reference in one way or another to accelerate the releae cycle by shortening the release cadence and turning it into a continuous flow.</li>
<li>Some reviewed publications claim that accelerating the release cycle can make it harder to perform re-engineering activities.</li>
<li>CD challenges and changes traditional planning towards continuous planning in order to achieve fast and frequent releases.</li>
<li>Tighter integration between planning and execution is required in order to achieve a more holisitic view on planning in CD.</li>
<li>It is important for the engineering and QA teams to ensure backward compatibility of enhancements, so that users perceive only improvements rather than experience any loss of functionality.</li>
<li>Code change activities tend to focus more on bug fixing and maintenance than functional- ity expansion</li>
<li>The architecture must be robust enough to allow the organization to invest its resources in offensive initiatives such as new functionalitity, product enhancements and innovation rather than defensive efforts such as bugfixes.</li>
<li>A major challenge in CD is to retain the balance between speed and quality. Some approaches reviewed by this study propose a focus on measuring and monitoring source code and architectural quality.</li>
<li>To avoid issues such as duplicated testing efforts and slow feedback loops it is important to make all testing activities transparent to individual developers.</li>

<p>What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>

<ul>
<li>This paper discussed the developments of continuous development over the years. This paper has performed a semantic study to identify, classify and analyze primary studies related to continuous development. The paper finds:
<ul>
<li>Two main motivations for the implementation of frequent software releases in the context of OSS projects, which are the project attractiveness/increase of participants and maintenance and increase of market share</li>
<li>Four main strategies are adopted by practitioners to implement frequent software releases in the context of OSS projects: time-based release, automated release, test-driven development and continuous delivery/deployment.</li>
<li>The main positive points associated to rapid releases are: quick return on customer needs, rapid delivery of new features, quick bug fixes, immediate release security patches, increased efficiency, entry of new collaborators, and greater focus on quality on the part of developers and testers.</li>
<li>The main negative points assocaited to rapid releases are reliability of new versions, increase in the “technical debt”, pressure felt by employees and community dependence.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Are these practices to be classified under dated, state of the art or state of the practice? Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The practices discussed are a combination of state of the art and state of the practice approaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
