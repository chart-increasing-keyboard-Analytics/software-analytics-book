<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Motivation</h2>
<p>Release engineering is a discipline involved with making software available for end users. Efforts spent within the development environment of a software system should eventually be integrated and deployed such that end users may benefit from them. In recent years, release engineers have developed and adopted techniques to build infrastructures and pipelines which automate the process of releasing software to an increasingly large degree. These modern approaches have resulted in various practices such as releasing new versions of a software system in significantly shorter cycles.</p>
<p>Due to these developments being industry-driven, release engineering forms a largely uncharted territory for software engineering research. It requires the attention from researchers both because these new practices have an often unanticipated impact on software studies and because they require empirical validation <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-adams2016a">4</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, this systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of the software analytics research that has been conducted so far on modern release engineering. Its main purpose is to identify the apparent gap between research and practice, in order to guide further research efforts.</p>
<div id="research-questions-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.1</span> Research Questions</h3>
<p>Contrary to what is regularly the case, advances in release engineering practices are driven by industry, instead of scientific research. Building on this idea, our questions are constructed to identify in which ways existing modern release engineering practices should still be studied in software analytics research. Our review thus aims to answer the following questions.</p>
<!-- TODO -->
<ul>
<li><p><strong>RQ 1:</strong> <em>How is modern release engineering done in practice?</em><br> This question aims to identify the so-called “state of the practice” in release engineering. We will summarize practices that have been adopted to drive release engineering forward. In addition we will identify the tools utilized to bring this about. Case studies will also be analyzed to this end.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RQ 2:</strong> <em>What aspects of modern release engineering have been studied in software analytics research so far?</em><br> In order to answer this question we investigate the practices that previous empirical studies have focused on. In doing so, we identify the associated costs and benefits that have been found, and the analysis methods used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RQ 3:</strong> <em>What aspects of modern release engineering make for relevant study objects in future software analytics research?</em><br> In answering this question we aim to identify the gap between practice and research in release engineering. This way, our intent is not only to guide but also to motivate future research.</p></li>

<div id="search-strategy-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.1</span> Search Strategy</h3>
<p>Since release engineering is a relatively new research topic, we took an exploratory approach in collecting any literature revolving around the topic of release engineering from the perspective of software analytics. This aided us in determining a more narrow scope for our survey, subsequently allowing us to find additional literature fitting this scope.</p>
<p>At the start of this project, we were provided with an initial seed of five papers as a starting point for our literature survey. These initial papers were <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-adams2016a">4</a>]</span>, <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-da2016a">37</a>]</span>, <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-da2014a">36</a>]</span>, <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-khomh2012a">69</a>]</span>, and <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-khomh2015a">68</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>We collected publications using two search engines: Scopus and Google Scholar. Each of the two search engines comprises several databases such as ACM Digital Library, Springer, IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect. The main query that we constructed is displayed in Figure 1. The publications found using this query were:</p>

<div id="study-selection" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.2</span> Study Selection</h3>
<p>We selected the studies that we wanted to include in the survey with aid of the aforementioned tool for storing the papers. In this tool, it is possible to label papers with tags and leave comments and ratings. Every paper is reviewed based on the selection criteria. Based on this, the tool allowed to filter out all papers that appeared not to be relevant for this literature survey.</p>
<p>The selection criteria are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The study must show (at least) one release engineering technique.</li>
<li>The study must not just show a release engineering technique, but analyze its performance compared to other techniques.</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on these selection criteria, the following papers appeared to be irrelevant for the scope of this survey:</p>
<!-- Example. TODO: actually exclude papers -->

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.3</span> Study Quality Assessment</h3>
<p>Based on <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kitchenham2004procedures">73</a>]</span>, the quality of a paper will be assessed by the evidence it provides, based on the following scale. All levels of quality in this scale will be accepted, except for level 5 (evidence obtained from expert opinion).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evidence obtained from at least one properly-designed randomised controlled trial.</li>
<li>Evidence obtained from well-designed pseudo-randomised controlled trials (i.e. non-random allocation to treatment).</li>
<li>Comparative studies in a real-world setting:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evidence obtained from comparative studies with concurrent controls and allocation not randomised, cohort studies, case-control studies or interrupted time series with a control group.</li>
<li>Evidence obtained from comparative studies with historical control, two or more single arm studies, or interrupted time series without a parallel control group.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Experiments in artificial settings:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evidence obtained from a randomised experiment performed in an artificial setting.</li>
<li>Evidence obtained from case series, either post-test or pre-test/post-test.</li>
<li>Evidence obtained from a quasi-random experiment performed in an artificial setting.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Evidence obtained from expert opinion based on theory or consensus.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, the studies will be examined to see if they contain any type of bias. For this, the same types of biases will be used as described by <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kitchenham2004procedures">73</a>]</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selection/Allocation bias: Systematic difference between comparison groups with respect to treatment.</li>
<li>Performance bias: Systematic difference is the conduct of comparison groups apart from the treatment being evaluated.</li>
<li>Measurement/Detection bias: Systematic difference between the groups in how outcomes are ascertained.</li>
<li>Attrition/Exclusion bias: Systematic differences between comparison groups in terms of withdrawals or exclusions of participants from the study sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>The studies will be labeled by their quality level and possible biases. This information can be used during the Data Synthesis phase to weigh the importance of individual studies <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-kitchenham2004procedures">73</a>]</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.4</span> Data Extraction</h3>
<p>To accurately capture the information contributed by each publication in our survey, we will use a systematic approach to extracting data. To guide this process, we will be using a data extraction form which describes what aspects of a publication are crucial to record. Besides general publication information (title, author etc.), the form contains questions that are based on our defined research questions. Furthermore, the form contains a section for quantitative research, where aspects such as population and evaluation will be documented. The form that is used for this is shown below:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.5</span> Data Synthesis</h3>
<p>To summarize the contributions and limitations of each of the included publications, we will apply a descriptive synthesis approach. In this part of our survey, we will compare the data that was extracted of the included publications. Publications with similar findings will be grouped and evaluated, and differences between groups of publications will be structured and elaborated on. In this we will compare them using specifics such as their study types, time of publication and study quality.</p>
<p>If the extracted data allows for a structured tabular visualization of similarities and differences between publications this we serve as an additional form of synthesis. However, this depends on the final included publications of this survey.</p>

<li>Method(s) of recruitment of participants: N/A (case study)</li>
<li>Sample size: 1,547 unique test cases, 312,502 executions, performed by 6,058 individuals on 2,009 software builds, 22 OS versions and 78 locales.</li>
<li>Evaluation/measurement description: Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Cliff’s delta, Cohen’s Kappa for Firefox Research Question (FF-RQ) 5.</li>
<li>Outcomes (FF-RQs; RR = rapid release; TR = traditional release):
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>RRs perform more test executions per day, but these tests focus on a smaller subset of the test case corpus.</li>
<li>RRs have less testers, but they have a higher workload.</li>
<li>RRs test fewer, but larger builds.</li>
<li>RRs test fewer platforms in total, but test each supported platform more thoroughly.</li>

<p>Semi-systematic literature survey:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study date: Unknown (before 2015)</li>
<li>Population description: Papers with main focus on:
<ul>
<li>Rapid Releases (RRs)</li>
<li>Aspect of software engineering largely impacted by RRs</li>
<li>An agile, lean or open source process having results of RRs</li>
<li>Excluding: opinion papers without empirical data on RRs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Method(s) of recruitment of participants: Scopus queries</li>
<li>Sample size: 24 papers</li>
<li>Outcomes:
<ul>
<li>Evidence is scarce. Often RRs are implemented as part of agile adoption. This makes it difficult to separate the impact of RRs from other process changes.</li>
<li>Originates from several software development paradigms: Agile, FOSS, Lean, internet-speed software development</li>
<li>Prevalence
<ul>
<li>Practiced in many software engineering domains, not just web applications</li>
<li>Between 23% and 83% of practitioners do RRs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Perceived) Problems:
<ul>
<li>Increased technical debt</li>
<li>RRs are in conflict with high reliability and high test coverage</li>
<li>Customers might be dipleased with RRs (many updates)</li>
<li>Time-pressure / Deadline oriented work</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Perceived) Benefits:
<ul>
<li>Rapid feedback leading to increased quality focus of the devs and testers</li>
<li>Easier monitoring of progress and quality</li>
<li>Customer satisfaction</li>
<li>Shorter time-to-market</li>

<li>Sequential development where multiple releases are under work simultaneously</li>
<li>Tools for automated testing and efficient deployment</li>

<li>Limitations:
<ul>
<li>Not all papers that present results about RRs, have “rapid release” mentioned in the abstract.</li>

<li>This analysis could be extended with industry case studies, to develop a checklist for analyzing company and ecosystem readiness for continuous delivery and continuous deployment.</li>
<li>The comprehensive reporting of the context and how the practice is implemented instead of merely referring to usage of the practice should be considered by future research.</li>
<li>Different stakeholders’ points of view, such as customer perceptions regarding practices require further research.</li>
<li>Research on DevOps would be highly relevant for release engineering and the continuous software engineering research domain.</li>

<li>Publication type: Conference paper</li>
<li>Type of study: Survey</li>
</ul>
<p>What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>Branching and merging
<ul>
<li>Software teams rely on Version Control Systems</li>
<li>Quality assurance activities like code reviews are used before doing a merge or even allowing a code change to be committed into a branch</li>
<li>Keep branches short-lived and merge often. If this is impossible, a rebase can be done.</li>
<li>“trunk-based development” can be applied to eliminate most branches below the master branch.</li>
<li>Feature toggles are used to provide isolation for new features in case of the absence of branches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Building and testing
<ul>
<li>To help assess build and test conflicts, many projects also provide “try” servers to development teams, which automatically runs a build and test process referred to as CI.</li>
<li>The CI process often does not run full test, but a representative subset.</li>
<li>The more intensive tests, such as integration, system or performance typically get run nightly or in weekends.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Build system:
<ul>
<li>GNU Make is the most popular file-based build system technology. Ant is the prototypical task-based build system technology. Lifecycle-based build technologies like Maven consider the build system of a project to have a sequence of standard build activities that together form a “build lifecycle.”</li>
<li>“Reproducible builds” involve for a given feature and hardware configuration of the code base, every build invoca- tion should yield bit-to-bit identical build results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Infrastructure-as-code
<ul>
<li>Containers or virtual machines are used to deploy new versions of the system for testing or even production.</li>
<li>It has been recommended that infrastructure code is to be stored in a separate VCS repository than source code, in order to restrict access to infrastructure code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deployment
<ul>
<li>The term “dark launching” corresponds to deploying new features without releasing them to the public, in which parts of the system automatically make calls to the hidden features in a way invisible to end users.</li>
<li>“Blue green deployment” deploys the next software version on a copy of the production environment, and changes this to be the main enviroment on release.</li>
<li>In “canary deployment” a prospective release of the software system is loaded onto a subset of the production environments for only a subset of users.</li>
<li>“A/B testing” deploys alternative A of a feature to the environment of a subset of the user base, while alternative B is deployed to the environment of another subset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Release
<ul>
<li>Once a deployed version of a system is released, the release engineers monitor telemetry data and crash logs to track the performance and quality of releases. Several frameworks and applications have been introduced for this.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Are these practices to be classified under dated, state of the art or state of the practice? Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of these practices are classified by the paper as state of the practice, but state of the art practices are also mentioned.</li>
</ul>
<p>What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>Branching and merging
<ul>
<li>No methodology or insight exists on how to empirically validate the best branching structure for a given organization or project, and what results in the smallest amount of merge conflicts.</li>
<li>Release engineers need to pay particular attention to conflicts and incompatibilities caused by evolving library and API dependencies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Building and testing
<ul>
<li>Speeding up CI might be the major concern of practitioners. This speed up can be achieved through predicting whether a code change will break the build, or by “chunking” code changes into a group and only compile and test each group once.</li>
<li>The concept of “green builds” slowly is becoming an issue, in the sense that frequent triggering of the CI server consumes energy.</li>
<li>Security of the release engineering pipeline in general, and the CI server in particular, also has become a major concern.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Release
<ul>
<li>Qualitative studies are not only essential to understand the rationale behind quantitative findings, but also to identify design patterns and best practices for build systems.
<ul>
<li>How can developers make their builds more maintainable and of higher quality?</li>
<li>What refactorings should be performed for which build system anti-patterns?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Identification and resolution of build bugs, i.e., source code or build specification changes that cause build breakage, possibly on a subset of the supported platforms.</li>
<li>Basic tools have a hard time determining what part of the system is necessary to build.</li>
<li>Studies on non-GNU Make build systems are missing.</li>
<li>Apart from identifying bottlenecks, such approaches should also suggest concrete refactorings of the build system specifications or source code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Infrastructure-as-code
<ul>
<li>Research on differences between infrastructure languages is lacking.</li>
<li>Best practices and design patterns for infrastructure-as-code need to be documented.</li>
<li>Qualitative analysis of infrastructure code will be necessary to understand how developers address different infrastructure needs.</li>
<li>Quantitative analysis of the version control and bug report systems can then help to determine which patterns were beneficial in terms of maintenance effort and/or quality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deployment
<ul>
<li>More emperical studies can be done to answer question like this:
<ul>
<li>Is blue-green deployment the fastest means to deploy a new version of a web app?</li>
<li>Are A/B testing and dark launching worth the investment and risk?</li>
<li>Should one use containers or virtual machines for a medium-sized web app in order to meet application performance and robustness criteria?</li>
<li>If an app is part of a suite of apps built around a common database, should each app be deployed in a different container?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Better tools for quality assurance are required, to prevent showstopper bugs from slipping through and requiring re-deployment of a mobile app version (with corresponding vetting), these include:
<ul>
<li>Defect prediction (either file- or commit-based)</li>
<li>Smarter/safer update mechanisms</li>
<li>Tools for improving code review</li>
<li>Generating tests</li>
<li>Filtering and interpreting crash reports</li>
<li>Prioritization and triaging of defect reports</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Release
<ul>
<li>More research is needed on determining which code change is the perfect one for triggering the release of one of these releases, or whether a canary is good enough to be released to another data centre.</li>
<li>Question such as the following should be investigated:
<ul>
<li>Should one release on all platforms at the same time?</li>
<li>In the case of defects, which platform should receive priority?</li>
<li>Should all platforms use the same version numbering, or should that be feature-dependent?</li>
<li>Research on the continuous delivery and rapid releases from other systems should be explored.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>What research gaps does this publication contain?</p>
<ul>
<li>As is common with surveys, it does not contain the state of the field today. More quantitive and qualitive research has been done, which can not possibly be included.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are these research gaps filled by any other publications in this survey?</p>

<li>Type of study: Emperical study</li>
</ul>
<p>What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>To give a context to the study, the paper describes the concept of traditional releases, rapid releases, their differences, and how issue reports are structured.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are these practices to be classified under dated, state of the art or state of the practice? Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>State of the practice. The paper describes common practices that were in use at the time of the publication.</li>
</ul>
<p>What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>The study mentions that comparing systems with different release structures is difficult since one has to distinguish to what extent the results are due to the release strategy and which are due to intricacies of the systems or organization itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>What research gaps does this publication contain?</p>
<ul>
<li>The main gap in this study is the specificity of the data. Only Mozilla has been considered, and external factors such as other organizational challenges which could have an effect on release time could not be included. More research that looks further into comparing this case to that of other organizations is needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are these research gaps filled by any other publications in this survey?</p>

</ul>
<p>Quantitative research publications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study start date: Used data starts from 1999</li>
<li>Study end date or duration: Used data ends in 2010</li>
<li>Population description: The paper describes multiple steps to describe their data collection approach. The paper collected the date and version number of each Firefox release. Tags within the VCS were used to link issue IDs to releases. The paper discards issues that are potential false positives: IDs that have less five digits, issues that refer to tests instead of bugfixes, any potential ID that is the name of a file. Since the commit logs are linked to the VCS tags, the paper is able to link the issue IDs found within these commit logs to the releases that correspond to those tags.</li>
<li>Method(s) of recruitment of participants: Firefox release history wiki and VCS logs</li>
<li>Sample size: 72114 issue reports from the Firefox system (34673 for traditional releases and 37441 for rapid releases)</li>
<li>Evaluation/measurement description: The paper aims to answer three research questions:
<ul>
<li>Are addressed issues integrated more quickly in rapid releases?
<ul>
<li>Approach: Through beanplots to compare the distributions, the paper first observes the lifetime of the issues of traditional and rapid releases. Next, it looks at the time span of the triaging, fixing, and integration phases within the lifetime of an issue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why can traditional releases integrate addressed issues more quickly?
<ul>
<li>Approach: the paper groups traditional and rapid releases into major and minor releases and study their integration delay through beanplots, Mann-Whiteney-Wilcoxon tests, Cliff’s delta, and MAD.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Did the change in the release strategy have an impact on the characteristics of delayed issues?
<ul>
<li>Approach: the paper builds linear regression models for both release approaches. The paper firstly estimates the degrees of freedom that can be spent on the models. Secondly, they check for metrics that are highly correlated using Spearman rank correlation tests and perform a redundancy check to remove redundant metrics. The paper then assesses the fit of our models using the ROC area and the Brier score. The ROC area is used to evaluate the degree of discrimination achieved by the model. The Brier score is used to evaluate the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. The used metrics include reporter experience, resolver experience, issue severity, issue priority, project queue rank, number of impacted files and fix time. A full list of metrics can be found in Table 2 of the paper.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Outcomes:
<ul>
<li>Are addressed issues integrated more quickly in rapid releases?
<ul>
<li>Results: There is no significant difference between traditional and rapid releases regarding issue lifetime. Results:</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why can traditional releases integrate addressed issues more quickly?
<ul>
<li>Results: Minor-traditional releases tend to have less integration delay than major/minor-rapid releases.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Did the change in the release strategy have an impact on the characteristics of delayed issues?
<ul>
<li>Results: The models achieve a Brier score of 0.05- 0.16 and ROC areas of 0.81-0.83. Traditional releases prioritize the integration of backlog issues, while rapid releases prioritize the inte- gration of issues of the current release cycle.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Limitations: Defects in the tools that were developed to perform the data collection and evaluation could have an effect on the outcomes. Furthermore, the way that issue IDs are linked to releases may not represent the total addressed issues per release. The results cannot be generalized as the evaluation was solely done on the Firefox system.</li>
<li>Future research: Further research can look into applying the same evaluation strategy to other organizations that switched from traditional to rapid release.</li>

<li>Outcomes:
<ul>
<li>How long are addressed issues typically delayed by the integration process?
<ul>
<li>Addressed issues are usually delayed in a rapid release cycle. Many delayed issues were addressed well before releases from which they were omitted. Many delayed issues were addressed well before releases from which they were omitted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can we accurately predict when an addressed issue will be integrated?
<ul>
<li>The prediction models achieve a weighted average precision between 0.59 to 0.88 and a recall between 0.62 to 0.88, with ROC areas of above 0.74. The models achieve better F-measure values than Zero-R.</li>

</ul>
<p>What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>This paper discussed the developments of continuous development over the years until June 2014. This paper has performed a semantic study to identify, classify and analyze primary studies related to continuous development. The paper has found the following major points:
<ul>
<li>Almost all primary studies make reference in one way or another to accelerate the releae cycle by shortening the release cadence and turning it into a continuous flow.</li>
<li>Some reviewed publications claim that accelerating the release cycle can make it harder to perform re-engineering activities.</li>
<li>CD challenges and changes traditional planning towards continuous planning in order to achieve fast and frequent releases.</li>
<li>Tighter integration between planning and execution is required in order to achieve a more holisitic view on planning in CD.</li>
<li>It is important for the engineering and QA teams to ensure backward compatibility of enhancements, so that users perceive only improvements rather than experience any loss of functionality.</li>
<li>Code change activities tend to focus more on bug fixing and maintenance than functional- ity expansion</li>
<li>The architecture must be robust enough to allow the organization to invest its resources in offensive initiatives such as new functionalitity, product enhancements and innovation rather than defensive efforts such as bugfixes.</li>
<li>A major challenge in CD is to retain the balance between speed and quality. Some approaches reviewed by this study propose a focus on measuring and monitoring source code and architectural quality.</li>
<li>To avoid issues such as duplicated testing efforts and slow feedback loops it is important to make all testing activities transparent to individual developers.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous and rapid experimentation is an emerging research topic with many possibilities for future work. This is why it’s important to keep up with the newly contributed studies and add them to future reviews to compare their findings.</li>

<p>What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>This paper discussed the developments of continuous development over the years. This paper has performed a semantic study to identify, classify and analyze primary studies related to continuous development. The paper finds:
<ul>
<li>Two main motivations for the implementation of frequent software releases in the context of OSS projects, which are the project attractiveness/increase of participants and maintenance and increase of market share</li>
<li>Four main strategies are adopted by practitioners to implement frequent software releases in the context of OSS projects: time-based release, automated release, test-driven development and continuous delivery/deployment.</li>
<li>The main positive points associated to rapid releases are: quick return on customer needs, rapid delivery of new features, quick bug fixes, immediate release security patches, increased efficiency, entry of new collaborators, and greater focus on quality on the part of developers and testers.</li>
<li>The main negative points assocaited to rapid releases are reliability of new versions, increase in the “technical debt”, pressure felt by employees and community dependence.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Are these practices to be classified under dated, state of the art or state of the practice? Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The practices discussed are a combination of state of the art and state of the practice approaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?</p>
<ul>
<li>A meta-model for the mining of open source bases in view of gathering data that leads to assessment of the quality of projects adoping the frequent release approach.</li>
