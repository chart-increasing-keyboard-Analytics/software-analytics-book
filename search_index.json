We have split up the novel area of Software Analytics into several sub topics. Every chapter addresses one such sub-topic of Software Analytics and is the outcome of a systematic literature review a laborious team of 3-4 students performed. With this book, we hope to structure the new field of Software Analytics and show how it is related to many long existing research fields.

This is not always the case, a build can break for several reasons. This chapter will give an overview of research done on build scripts and continuous integration. 5.2 Research Questions What are causes of a broken build? With which goals is continuous integration applied? What can be used to effectively fix a broken build? 5.3 Search Strategy Using the initial seed consisting of Bird and Zimmermann (2017), Beller, Gousios, and Zaidman (2017a), Rausch et al. (2017), Beller, Gousios, and Zaidman (2017b), Pinto and Rebou√ßas (2018), Zhao et al. (2017), Widder et al. (2018) and Hilton et al. (2016) we used references and similar keywords to find new papers to analyze. 5.4 Study Selection Through this we found the following papers 5.5 Summary of papers 5.5.1 Bird and Zimmermann (2017) This is a US patent grant for a method of predicting software build errors. This patent is owned my Microsoft. Using logistic regression a prediction can be made on the probability of a build failing. Using this method build errors can be better anticipated, which decreases the time until the build works again. 5.5.2 Vassallo et al. (2017) Discusses the difference in failures on continuous integration between open source software (OSS) and industrial software projects. For this 349 Java OSS projects and 418 project from ING Nederland, a financial organisation. Using cluser analysis it was observed that both kinds of projects share similar build failures, but in other cases very different patterns emerge. 5.5.3 Hassan and Wang (2018) This paper uses TravisTorrent (Beller, Gousios, and Zaidman (2017b)) to show that 22% of code commits include changes in build script files to keep the build working or to fix the build. In the paper a tool is proposed to automatically fix build failures based on previous changes. 5.5.4 Vassallo et al. (2018) This paper proposes a tool called BART to help developers fix build errors. This tool eliminates the need to browse error logs which can be very long by generating a summary of the failure with useful information. 5.5.5 Zampetti et al. (2017) This paper studies the usage of static analysis tools in 20 Java open source software projects hosted on GitHub and using Travic CI as continuous integration infrastructure. There is investigated which tools are being used, what types of issues make the build fail or raise warnings and how is responded to broken builds. "]
