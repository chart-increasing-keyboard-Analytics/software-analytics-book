We have split up the novel area of Software Analytics into several sub topics. Every chapter addresses one such sub-topic of Software Analytics and is the outcome of a systematic literature review a laborious team of 3-4 students performed. With this book, we hope to structure the new field of Software Analytics and show how it is related to many long existing research fields.
