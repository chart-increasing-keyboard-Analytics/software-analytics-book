We have split up the novel area of Software Analytics into several sub topics. Every chapter addresses one such sub-topic of Software Analytics and is the outcome of a systematic literature review a laborious team of 3-4 students performed. With this book, we hope to structure the new field of Software Analytics and show how it is related to many long existing research fields.

This is not always the case, a build can break for several reasons. This chapter will give an overview of research done on build configurations and continuous integration. 3.2 Research Questions RQ1 What is the current state of the art in the field of build analytics? RQ2 What is the current state of practice in the field of build analytics? RQ3 What future research can we expect in the field of build analytics? 3.3 Search Strategy Using the initial seed consisting of Bird and Zimmermann (2017), Beller, Gousios, and Zaidman (2017a), Rausch et al. (2017), Beller, Gousios, and Zaidman (2017b), Pinto and Rebouças (2018), Zhao et al. (2017), Widder et al. (2018) and Hilton et al. (2016) we used references to find new papers to analyze. 3.4 Study Selection Through this we found the following papers 3.5 Summary of papers 3.5.1 Bird and Zimmermann (2017) Initial Seed This is a US patent grant for a method of predicting software build errors. This patent is owned by Microsoft. Using logistic regression a prediction can be made on the probability of a build failing. Using this method build errors can be better anticipated, which decreases the time until the build works again. 3.5.2 Beller, Gousios, and Zaidman (2017a) Initial Seed This paper explores data from Travis CI1 on a large scale by analyzing 2,640,825 build logs of Java and Ruby builds. It uses TravisTorrent as a data source. It is found that the number one reason for failing builds it test failure. It also explores differences in testing between Java and Ruby. 3.5.3 Rausch et al. (2017) Initial Seed A stuy on the build results of 14 open source software Java projects. It is similar to Beller, Gousios, and Zaidman (2017a), albeit on a smaller scale. It does go more in depth on the result and changes over time. 3.5.4 Beller, Gousios, and Zaidman (2017b) Initial Seed This paper introduces TravisTorrent, a dataset containing analyzed builds from more than 1,000 projects. This data is freely downloadable from the internet. It uses GHTorrent to link the information from travis to commits on GitHub. 3.5.5 Pinto and Rebouças (2018) Initial Seed This paper is a survey amongst Travis CI users. It found that users are not sure whether a job failure represents a failure or not, that inadequate testing is the most common (technical) reason for build breakage and that people feel that there is a false sense of confidence when blindly trusing tests. 3.5.6 Zhao et al. (2017) Initial Seed This paper analyzed approximately 160,000 projects written in seven different programming languages. It notes that adoption of CI is often part of a reorganization. It collected information on the differences before and after adoption of CI. There is also a survey amongst developers to learn about their experiences in adopting Travis CI. 3.5.7 Widder et al. (2018) Initial Seed This paper analyzes what factors have impact on abandonment of Travis. They find that increased build complexity reduces the chance of abandonment, but larger projects abandon at a higher rate and that a project’s language has significant but varying effect. A surprising result is that metrics of configuration attempts and knowledge dispersion in the project don’t affect the rate of abandonment. 3.5.8 Hilton et al. (2016) Initial Seed This paper explores which CI system developers use, how developers use CI and why developers use CI. For this it analyzes data from Github, Travis CI and it conducts a developer survey. It finds that projects using CI release twice as often, accept pull requests faster and have developers who are less worried about breaking the build. 3.5.9 Vassallo et al. (2017) References Beller, Gousios, and Zaidman (2017a) This paper discusses the difference in failures on continuous integration between open source software (OSS) and industrial software projects. For this 349 Java OSS projects and 418 project from ING Nederland, a financial organization. Using cluser analysis it was observed that both kinds of projects share similar build failures, but in other cases very different patterns emerge. 3.5.10 Hassan and Wang (2018) References Beller, Gousios, and Zaidman (2017b) This paper uses TravisTorrent (Beller, Gousios, and Zaidman (2017b)) to show that 22% of code commits include changes in build script files to keep the build working or to fix the build. In the paper a tool is proposed to automatically fix build failures based on previous changes. 3.5.11 Vassallo et al. (2018) References Beller, Gousios, and Zaidman (2017a), Rausch et al. (2017) This paper proposes a tool called BART to help developers fix build errors. This tool eliminates the need to browse error logs which can be very long by generating a summary of the failure with useful information. 3.5.12 Zampetti et al. (2017) Referenced by Vassallo et al. (2018) This paper studies the usage of static analysis tools in 20 Java open source software projects hosted on GitHub and using Travic CI as continuous integration infrastructure. There is investigated which tools are being used, what types of issues make the build fail or raise warnings and how is responded to broken builds. 3.6 What is the current state of practice in the field of build analytics? In this section, I will examine scientific papers to analyse the current trend of build analytics in the software development industry. 3.6.1 Fowler and Foemmel (2006) In this paper, Martin talks about the current state of the software industry in terms of Continuous Integration (CI) and comments on the practises required to implement CI effectively. He talks about his experience working for a large English electronics company where the development of a project took two years and the integration process took several months. Integration is a long and unpredictable process. Martin suggested this approach and that the two most common reactions he got were: “it can’t work (here)” or “doing it won’t make much difference”. He expresses that most engineers don’t know how simple the process can be of setting the CI framework up. In this way, we get a glimpse into the practises popular within the industry regarding build analytics. 3.6.2 Hilton et al. (2016) This paper examines the usage, costs and benefits of Continuous Integration. A survey conducted in open-source projects indicated that 40% of all projects used CI. Of the projects that used CI, 90% used Travis for their CI services. They also determine that the more popular projects use CI but there is no correlation between the popularity of language and usage of CI. It also observes that the median project introduces CI a year into development. The paper claims that CI is widely used in practise nowadays and CI adoption rates will increase even further in the future. 3.6.3 Rausch et al. (2017) Version Control Systems (VCS) such as GitHub, and hosted build automation platforms such as Travis, have made Continuous Integration is widely available for projects of every size. This paper suggests that CI is widely used and has improved the quality of processes and developed software itself. However, the article suggests that there is little known about the variety and frequency of errors that cause builds to fail. It suggests that developers should eliminate flaky tests and address common issues regularly such as broken interaction with repositories to keep the build system healthy. 3.6.4 Stolberg (2009) This paper defines CI as a key element in agile software development and testing environment. It also uses Marin Fowler’s practises of CI (as discussed previously) and expresses the importance of CI in the software industry. References "],
