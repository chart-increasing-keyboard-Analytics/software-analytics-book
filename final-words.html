<h4><span class="header-section-number">A.1.1.1</span> Expectations, outcomes, and challenges of modern code review</h4>
<p>Reference: <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-bacchelli2013expectations">10</a>]</span></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This paper describes research about the goals and actual effects of code reviews. Interviews and experiments have been done with people in the programming field.</p>
<p>One of the main conclusions is that the main effect of doing code reviews is that everyone involved understands the code better. This is opposed to what the goal of code reviews generally is: discovering errors.</p>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sub-topic</em>: in practice; tools</li>
<li><em>Research method</em>: empirical; qualitative</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: N/A</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: Data collected from interviews, surveys and code reviews</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What are the motivations and expectations for modern code review? Do they change from managers to developers and testers?</em> The top motivation for code reviews is finding defects, closely followed by code improvement. There does not seem to be a large difference between managers, developers and testers.</li>
<li><em>What are the actual outcomes of modern code review? Do they match the expectations?</em> Code improvements are the most seen outcomes of code review, followed by code understanding and social communication. The outcomes do not match the expectations well. For example, only 14% of researched review comments was about code defects, while about 44% chose finding defects as the main motivation for doing code review.</li>
<li><em>What are the main challenges experienced when performing modern code reviews relative to the expectations and outcomes?</em> The main challenges is by far understanding the code under review. This occurs for example when code has to be reviewed that is not in the same system as a developers works on daily.</li>
</ul>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ2</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tools used</em>: CodeFlow, a reviewing tool. It is not publicly available.</li>
<li><em>Company/organization</em>: Microsoft</li>
<li><em>Evaluation</em>: At the time of this paper, it still focusses mainly on fixing errors, and not on the more often ocurring results of doing code review.</li>
</ul>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ3</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Future research challenges</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research on automating code review tasks. This mainly concerns low-level tasks, like checking boundary conditions or catching common mistakes.</li>
<li>Research on code comprehension during code review. According to the authors research has been done on this with new developers in mind, but it would also be applicable to code reviews. The authors note that IDEs often include tools for code comprehension, but code review tools do not.</li>
<li>Research on awareness and learning during code review. Those two aspects were cited as motivations for code review by developers. Future research could research these aspects more explicitly.</li>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
The broad research questions answered in this article are: How is code review performed in industry today? Which commonalities and variations exist between code review processes of different teams and companies? The article describes a classification scheme for change-based code review processes in industry. This scheme is based on descriptions of the code review processes of eleven companies, obtained from interviews with software engineering professionals that were performed during a Grounded Theory study.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
This paper, published in 2017, is trying to answer 3 RQs. Firstly, how prevalent is change-based review in the industry? Secondly, does the chance that code review remains in use increase if code review is embedded into the process (and its supporting tools) so that it does not require a conscious decision to do a review? Thirdly, are the intended and acceptable levels of review effects a mediator in determining the code review process?</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
This paper focus on the influence of several non-technical factors on code review response time and outcome. An empirical study of code review process for WebKit, a large open source project was described to see the influence. Specifically, the authors replicated some previously studied factors and extended several more factors that had not beed explored.</p>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sub-topic</em>: open-source, impact</li>
<li><em>Research method</em>: empirical study</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: WebKit</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: WebKit code review data extracted from Bugzilla.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>What factors can influence how long it takes for a patch to be reviewed?</em> The organizational and personal factors influence review timeliness. Some factors that influenced the time required to review a patch, such as the size of the patch itself or the part of the code base being modified, are unsurprising and are likely related to the technical complexity of a given change. The most influential factors of the code review process on review time are the organization a patch writer is affiliated with and their level of participation within the project.</p></li>
<li><p><em>What factors influence the outcome of the review process?</em> The organizational and personal factors influence the likelihood of a patch being accepted. The most influential factors of the code review process on patch acceptance are the organization a patch writer is affiliated with and their level of participation within the project.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ3</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Future research challenges</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research on studying how best to interpret empirical software engineering research within the context of contextual factors. Understanding the reasons behind observable developer behaviour requires an understanding of the contexts, processes, organizational and individual factors that can influence code review and its outcome.</li>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>This article primirarily discusses some non-technical factors that influence the code review process. This are factors like review experience, amount of contributions to a project and company affiliation.</p>
<p>It is found that the most important factors influencing the code review process, in terms of both review time and patch acceptance, are the organization affiliation of the patch writer and the amount of participation of the patch writer in the project.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>What factors can influence how long it takes for a patch to be reviewed?</em> “Based on the results of two empirical studies, we found that both technical (patch size and component) , as well as non-technical (organization, patch writer experience, and reviewer activity) factors affect review timeliness when studying the effect of individual variables. While priority appears to influence review time for WebKit, we were not able to confirm this for Blink.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>What factors influence the outcome of the review process?</em> “Our findings from both studies suggest that patch writer experience affects code review outcome.

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>A code review data analyzation platform developed and used by Microsoft is discussed. It is mainly presented what users of the system think of it and how its use influences development teams. One of the conclusions is that in general, the platform has a positive influence on development teams and their products.</p>

<li><em>Tools used:</em> CodeFlow, CodeFlow Analytics</li>
<li><em>Company/organization using the tool:</em> Microsoft</li>
<li><em>Evaluation of the tool:</em> CodeFlow has already had a positive implace on development teams because of its simplicity, low barrier for feedback and flexible support of Microsoft’s disparate engineering systems. But some challenges such as dealing with branches and linking reviews to commits need to improve.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for CodeFlow Analytics: the tool is being used increasingly throughout Microsoft, with different teams using the tool for different purposes. It is for example effectively used to create dashboards with code review evaluation information, or for examining past reviews in detail. However, some parts of the tool still need to improve in terms of user-friendliness, for example because some functionality is difficult to find.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
To investigate how industry carries out software reviews and in what forms, this paper conducted a two-part survey in 2002, the first part based on a national initiative in Germany and the second involving companies worldwide. Additionally, this paper also include some fundamental concepts of code review, such as functionalities of code review.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
As code review has many uses and benefits, the authors hope to find out whether the current code review methods are sufficiently efficient. They also research whether other methods may be more efficient. With experience gained at Microsoft and with support of data, the authors posit (1) that code reviews often do not find functionality issues that should block a code submission; (2) that effective code reviews should be performed by people with a specific set of skills; and (3) that the social aspect of code reviews cannot be ignored.</p>

<li><em>Sub-topic</em>: impact</li>
<li><em>Research method</em>: empirical</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: not mentioned</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: data collected from engineering systems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>In what situations, do code reviews provide more value than others?</em> Unlike inspections, code reviews do not require participants to be in the same place nor do they happen at a fixed, prearranged time. Aligning with a distributed nature of many projects, code reviews are asynchronous and frequently supporting geographically distributed reviewers.</li>
<li><em>What is the value of consistency of applying code reviews equally to all code changes?</em> Code review usefulness is negatively correlated with the size of a code review. With 20 or more changed files, the more files there are in a single review, the lower the overall rate of useful feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ3</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Future research challenges</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Research on undocumented changes of code review because prior research has neglected.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to its costs, code reviewing practice is a topic deserving to be better understood, systematized and applied to software engineering workflow with more precision than the best practice currently prescribes.</p></li>

<p>Reference: <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-gousios2014exploratory">73</a>]</span></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
This article focuses on how much pull requests are being used and how they are used, focusing on GitHub. For example, it is concluded that pull-requests are not being used that much, that pull-requests are being merged fast after they have been submitted, and that a pull request not being merged is most of the time not caused by technical errors in the pull-request.</p>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sub-topic</em>: open-source, in practice</li>
<li><em>Research method</em>: empirical; qualitative for finding out reasons for closing pull request, rest quantitative.</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: Custom developed tools, available online</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: GHTorrent dataset, along with data collected by authors. The last is also available online</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How popular is the pull based development model?</em> “14% of repositories are using pull requests on Github. Pull requests and shared repositories are equally used among projects. Pull request usage is increasing in absolute numbers, even though the proportion of repositories using pull requests has decreased slightly.”</li>
<li><em>What are the lifecycle characteristics of pull requests?</em> “Most pull requests are less than 20 lines long and processed (merged or discarded) in less than 1 day. The discussion spans on average to 3 comments, while code reviews affect the time to merge a pull request. Inclusion of test code does not affect the time or the decision to merge a pull request. Pull requests receive no special treatment, irrespective whether they come from contributors or the core team.”</li>
<li><em>What factors affect the decision and the time required to merge a pull request?</em> “The decision to merge a pull request is mainly influenced by whether the pull request modifies recently modified code. The time to merge is influenced by the developer’s previous track record, the size of the project and its test coverage and the project’s openness to external contributions.”</li>
<li><em>Why are some pull requests not merged?</em> “53% of pull requests are rejected for reasons having to do with the distributed nature of pull based development. Only 13% of the pull requests are rejected due to technical reasons.”</li>
</ul>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ2</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tools used</em>: GitHub PR system</li>
<li><em>Company/organization</em>: Several open-source projects</li>
<li><em>Evaluation</em>: N/A</li>
</ul>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ3</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Future research challenges</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>More research is needed on <em>drive-by commits</em>, which the paper loosely defines as commits added to a repository through a PR by a user that has never contributed to the repository and hence does so for the first time. Often this new contributor also has created a fork for the sole purpose of creating this PR. More research is needed on accurately defining drive-by commits and on assessing their implications.</li>
<li>More research is needed on the effect of the democratization of the develoment process, which occurs for example through the use of pull requests. Democratization could for example lead to a substantially stronger commons ecosystem.</li>
<li>Validating the used models on data from different sources and on projects on different languages.</li>
<li>Research on the motives of developers to work in a highly transparent workspace.</li>
<li>Research on formation of teams and management hierarchies with respect to open-source projects.</li>
<li>Research on novel code review practices.</li>
<li>Research on ways to managing tasks in the pull-based development model.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges in practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of tools to help the core team of a project with prioritizing their work. The paper gives as an example a tool which would suggest whether a pull request can be merged or not, because this can be predicted with fairly high accuracy.</li>
<li>Development of tools that would suggest categories of improvement for pull request, for example by suggesting that more documentation needs to be added.</li>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
This paper focuses on the influence of doing light-weight code reviews on software quality. In particular, the effect of review coverage (the part of the code that has been reviewed) and review participation (a measure for how much reviewers are involved in the review process) are being assessed.</p>
<p>It turns out that both aspects improve software quality when they are higher. Review participation is the most influential. According to the authors there are other aspects, which they have not looked into, that are of significant importance for the review process.</p>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ1</strong>:</p>
<ul>

<li><em>Tools</em>: N/A</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: Data extracted from Qt, VTK and ITK code review dataset and necessary metrics including version control metrics, coverage metrics and participation metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Is there a relationship between code review coverage and post-release defects?</em> Although review coverage is negatively associated with software quality in our models, several defect-prone components have high coverage rates, suggesting that other properties of the code review process are at play.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Is there a relationship between code review participation and post-release defects?</em> Lack of participation in code review has a negative impact on software quality. Reviews without discussion are associated with higher post-release defect counts, suggesting that the amount of discussion generated during review should be considered when making integration decisions.</p></li>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">A.1.1.15</span> Who should review my code? A file location-based code-reviewer recommendation approach for modern code review</h4>
<p>Reference: <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-thongtanunam2015should">180</a>]</span></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>This paper presents (1) research on how often a reviewer cannot be found for a code change and the influence of this on the time it takes to process a code change, (2) a tool (<em>RevFinder</em>) for automatically suggesting reviewers based on files reviewed previously, and (3) an empirical evaluation of that tool on four open-source projects.</p>
<p>Of the researched projects, up to 30% of the code changes have problems finding a reviewer. These reviews take on average 12 days longer. Also, it is found that RevFinder works 3 to 4 times better than an existing tool.</p>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sub-topic</em>: reviewers; tools</li>
<li><em>Research method</em>: quantitative; empirical</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: Custom</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: Custom: Gerrit review data from Android, OpenStack, Qt and LibreOffice</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How do reviews with code-reviewer assignment problem impact reviewing time?</em> “4%-30% of reviews have code-reviewer assignment problem. These reviews significantly take 12 days longer to approve a code change. A code-reviewer recommendation tool is necessary in distributed software development to speed up a code review process.”</li>
<li><em>Does RevFinder accurately recommend code-reviewers?</em> “RevFinder correctly recommended 79% of reviews with a top-10 recommendation. RevFinder is 4 times more accurate than ReviewBot. This indicates that leveraging a similarity of previously reviewed file path can accurately recommend code-reviewers.”</li>
<li><em>Does RevFinder provide better ranking of recommended code-reviewers?</em> “RevFinder recommended the correct code-reviewers with a median rank of 4. The code-reviewers ranking of RevFinder is 3 times better than that of ReviewBot, indicating that RevFinder provides a better ranking of correct code-reviewers.”</li>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">A.1.1.16</span> Revisiting code ownership and its relationship with software quality in the scope of modern code review</h4>
<p>Reference: <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-thongtanunam2016revisiting">179</a>]</span></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>This paper researches the effect code reviews have on code ownership. This question is answered by looking at two open-source projects. It was found that a lot of contributors do not submit code changes for a specific ticket, but still do quite some reviewing. It was also found that code that contains post-release errors has often been reviewed or authored by people who neither author or review often.</p>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sub-topic</em>: code ownership</li>
<li><em>Research method</em>: empirical; quantitative</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: R; Custom</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: Review dataset from Hamasaki et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-hamasaki2013does">77</a>]</span>. Code dataset from the Qt system from McIntosh et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-mcintosh2014impact">129</a>]</span>. Ammended with custom datasets for Qt and OpenStack.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>How do code authoring and reviewing contributions differ?</em> “The developers who only contribute to a module by reviewing code changes account for the largest set of contributors to that module. Moreover, 18%-50% of these review-only developers are documented core developers of the studied systems, suggesting that code ownership heuristics that only consider authorship activity are missing the activity of these major contributors.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>Should code review activity be used to refine traditional code ownership heuristics?</em> “Many minor authors are major reviewers who actually make large contributions to the evolution of modules by reviewing code changes. Code review activity can be used to refine traditional code ownership heuristics to more accurately identify the defect-prone modules.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>Is there a relationship between review-specific and review-aware code ownership heuristics and defect-proneness?</em> “Even when we control for several confounding factors, the proportion of developers in the minor author &amp; minor reviewer category shares a strong relationship with defectproneness. Indeed, modules with a larger proportion of developers without authorship or reviewing expertise are more likely to be defect-prone.”</p></li>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">A.1.1.17</span> Review participation in modern code review</h4>
<p>Reference: <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-thongtanunam2017review">178</a>]</span></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
This paper discusses the factors that influence review participation in code review. Previous studies identified that review participation influences the code review process significantly, but did not study the factors that actually influence review participation.</p>
<p>It was most importantly found that “(…) the review participation history, the description length, the number of days since the last modification of files, the past involvement of an author, and the past involvement of reviewers share a strong relationship with the likelihood that a patch will suffer from poor review participation.”</p>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ1</strong>:</p>

<li><em>Sub-topic</em>: review participation</li>
<li><em>Research method</em>: empirical; quantitative</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: N/A</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: Review data for the Android, Qt and OpenStack projects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>What patch characteristics share a relationship with the likelihood of a patch not being selected by reviewers?</em> “We find that the number of reviewers of prior patches, the number of days since the last modification of the patched files share a strong increasing relationship with the likelihood that a patch will have at least one reviewer. The description length is also a strong indicator of a patch that is likely to not be selected by reviewers.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>What patch characteristics share a relationship with the likelihood of a patch not being discussed?</em> “We find that the description length, churn, and the discussion length of prior patches share an increasing relationship with the likelihood that a patch will be discussed. We also find that the past involvement of reviewers shares an increasing relationship with the likelihood. On the other hand, the past involvement of an author shares an inverse relationship with the likelihood.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>What patch characteristics share a relationship with the likelihood of a patch receiving slow initial feedback?</em> “We find that the feedback delay of prior patches shares a strong relationship with the likelihood that a patch will receive slow initial feedback. Furthermore, a patch is likely to receive slow initial feedback if its purpose is to introduces new features.”</p></li>

<p>Reference: <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-zanjani2016automatically">195</a>]</span></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>This paper introduces <em>cHRev</em>, a reviewer recommendation approach that, according to the paper, works better in most circumstances than <em>RevFinder</em> introduces by Thongtanunam et al. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-thongtanunam2015should">180</a>]</span>. It recommends reviewers based on their previous review activity. For this it notably uses the frequency of reviews for a specific part of the system and also how recent the reviewing activity was.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Sub-topic</em>: reviewer recomendation</li>
<li><em>Research method</em>: quantitative; empirical</li>
<li><em>Tools</em>: Custom</li>
<li><em>Datasets</em>: Reviewing data for Mylyn, Eclipse, Android, and MS Office</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research questions and answers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>What is the accuracy of cHRev in recommending reviewers on real software systems across closed and open source projects?</em> “cHRev makes accurate reviewer recommendations in terms of precision and recall. On average, less than two recommendations are needed to find the first correct reviewer in both closed and open source systems.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>How do the accuracies of cHRev (trained from the code review history), REVFINDER (also, trained from the code review history, albeit differently), xFinder (trained from the commit history), and RevCom (trained from a combination of the code review and commit histories) compare in recommending code reviewers?</em> “cHRev performs much better than REVFINDER which is based on reviewers of files with similar names and paths and xFinder which relies on source code repository data, and cHRev is statistically equivalent to RevCom which requires both past reviews and commits.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For answering <strong>RQ2</strong>:</p>
